# SpaceBox
A collection of CSS classes designed to make your life easier

Designed with simplicity in mind, with a "function first" philosophy. I come up with a lot of spur-of-the-moment project ideas, and I don't like anything to get in the way of my quick-prototyping experience.

However, when I need a webpage for said prototype, I find myself getting distracted trying to make things look nice when I could be spending that time implementing functionality (you know, the fun part) -- That's why I made SpaceBox, to be able to skip right to the fun part while also having my page look nice.

Using SpaceBox, you can put together a layout for you project within minutes that still looks like you spent hours polishing it, because SpaceBox does all of the polishing for you. Then, when you're ready to make things look a little bit cleaner, SpaceBox is super customizable and so easy to use that you can expand upon your layouts and customize them exactly how you want them.
